              <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?"</p>
              <p><strong>Background:</strong> Belle is the titular female protagonist of Disney's 1991 animated feature film <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. She is the only daughter of Maurice, an inventor with whom she resides in a small French village. The townsfolk labeled Belle as an outcast because of her free spirit. She dreams of escaping her “poor provincial town” in France. Belle's passion for fantastical stories, coupled with her outcast status, left her yearning for a life of adventure outside her small village. She is beautiful but is unaware of her own good looks, in which Gaston constantly pursues her. She unexpectedly gets her wish when she falls in love with the Beast after saving her father. Ultimately, when Belle embarks on her unexpected adventure, she winds up trading her own freedom for her father’s, learning from the castle’s residents and the Beast himself, and creating a new life for herself.</p>
              <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Belle is intelligent, confident, and outspoken. She is known throughout her village for her beauty and brains, though she doesn’t acknowledge it. She pays very little attention to her appearance, unlike the conceited Gaston. Wise in her decisions, Belle is obstinate in upholding her opinions and values.</p>
