      <h3>Belle</h3>
      <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?"</p>
      <p><strong>Background:</strong> Belle is the titular female protagonist of Disney's 1991 animated feature film Beauty and the Beast. She is the only daughter of Maurice, an inventor with whom she resides in a small French village. The townsfolk labeled Belle an outcast because of her free spirit. She dreams of escaping her “poor provincial town” in France. Belle's passion for fantastical stories, coupled with her outcast status, left her yearning for a life of adventure outside her small village. She is beautiful but is unaware of her own good looks, in which Gaston constantly pursues her. She unexpectedly gets her wish when she falls in love with the Beast after saving her father. Ultimately, when Belle embarks on her unexpected adventure, she winds up trading her own freedom for her father’s, learning from the castle’s residents and the Beast himself, and creating a new life for herself.</p>
      <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Belle is a very intelligent woman, gaining a significant amount of knowledge over the years through her love for books, providing her with amazing vocabulary and active imagination. She is very confident and outspoken in her opinions, with villages being charmed by her “beauty and brains”. Belle is known throughout the village for her beauty, though she doesn’t acknowledge this. She is greatly aware that her fellow citizens think of her as “odd” or “peculiar”. Belle pays very little attention to her appearance, unlike the much conceited Gaston, who only wishes to wed her due to outward appearances. Being wise in her decisions, Belle is quite obstinate when it comes to upholding her opinions and who she interacts with.</p>

      <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “I spent my whole life in this tower, but I am ready to break free!”</p>
      <p><strong>Background:</strong> As a baby, Rapunzel was abducted by Mother Gothel and locked away in a remote tower for eighteen years. During her stay in the tower, far away from the city, she grew fascinated with the phenomenon of "floating lights" that would appear only on her birthday. With the help of Flynn Rider, a thief, Rapunzel escaped from the tower to learn more about the lights and pursue her dream of exploring the outside world. With this, she ventured to her hometown and with her love, Flynn Rider, rode a boat underneath the floating lights. She eventually realized that she was the lost princess of Corona. She found her long-lost family, as she cut her hair off–the very thing connecting her to her past life. She decided to live her life anew, upholding the responsibility of the royal had always been.</p>
